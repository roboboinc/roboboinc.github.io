description: <p>Introducing the Necto Usense, a revolutionary and practical device that will enable users to take measurements effortlessly and provide extra features like reminder based on positioning of the device, security control and much more. The device is one of the first in our portfolio of hybrid production and distribution products. This means that users are able to benefit from this device and its features very soon. </p> <b>Hardware Features</b><p>This device version features an Ultrasonic range finder capable of measuring up to 5 meters (note that this can be extended to greater distances, the cost increases depending on the maximum distance required). This version can be powered by removable battery or via USB.</p> <b>Current Application Features</b> <p> The device on its own is not much, although functions can be enabled for it to carry out various standalone functions, we intend that it is used with our Android Necto Controller application which includes the following features. Note that the following list will be updated accordingly as the application is developed further. </p> <p><img src="img/portfolio/usense/usense-prototype-to-real-side-by-side.png" border="0" alt="Necto Usense Prototype Images" width="557" height="241"> </p> <p> <b>Video Demo</b></p> <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UCB8tsL8tjY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
